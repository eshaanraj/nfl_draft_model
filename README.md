# 🏈 NFL Draftability Prediction Model

This project predicts whether a college football player will be **drafted** or **not drafted** into the NFL based on their **NFL Combine performance metrics**.  

Using historical combine data and machine learning, the model explores how measurable athletic performance correlates with draft outcomes.

## 📖 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict whether a player will be drafted into the NFL.  
- **Inputs**: Player combine metrics (e.g., 40-yard dash, bench press, vertical jump, shuttle times, height, weight).  
- **Output**: Binary classification → **Drafted (Yes)** or **Not Drafted (No)**.  
- **Methods**: Supervised machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, or XGBoost — see notebook).  
- **Why**: Demonstrates how data science can provide insights into professional scouting and draft outcomes.
